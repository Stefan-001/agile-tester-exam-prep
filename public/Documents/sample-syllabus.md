# Agile Tester Foundations
This section covers core principles, roles, and collaboration practices in Agile testing.

## Terms
- Agile Testing: A testing practice that follows the principles of agile software development.
- Whole-Team Approach: Collaboration between testers, developers, and business stakeholders.
- Definition of Done (DoD): A shared understanding of completion criteria for a backlog item.
- Test Pyramid: A guideline emphasizing more low-level tests than high-level UI tests.

## Sample Questions
Q: A team wants to ensure shared understanding of when a story is complete. What artifact should they define and continuously refine?
- A) Sprint Goal
- B) Definition of Done
- C) Definition of Ready
- D) Release Plan
Correct: B
Explain:
- A: Sprint goals provide direction, not completion criteria
- B: Correct - DoD sets completion criteria
- C: DoR focuses on entry conditions for planning
- D: A high-level timeline, not completion criteria

Q: In Agile testing, which practices best support fast feedback and maintainable quality? (Select two)
- A) Heavy reliance on manual regression testing
- B) Extensive end-to-end UI testing for all cases
- C) Layered test automation aligned to the Test Pyramid
- D) Continuous integration with automated checks
Correct: C,D
Explain:
- A: Manual-only regression slows feedback loops
- B: Overuse of E2E tests makes suites brittle and slow
- C: Correct - balanced pyramid ensures maintainable suites
- D: Correct - CI enables rapid feedback

# Collaboration & Communication
Focus on cross-functional collaboration, examples, and clear acceptance criteria.

## Terms
- Three Amigos: Collaboration between business, developer, and tester to refine requirements.
- Acceptance Criteria: Conditions that a software product must satisfy to be accepted by a user.
- Example Mapping: A technique to discover rules and examples for a user story.

## Sample Questions
Q: During refinement, the team uses examples to clarify ambiguous rules and discover edge cases. Which practice is this?
- A) Pair programming
- B) Example Mapping
- C) Code review
- D) Risk-based testing
Correct: B
Explain:
- A: Pairing focuses on coding together
- B: Correct - examples drive shared understanding
- C: Reviews assess code, not story rules via examples
- D: Risk-based testing prioritizes test effort by risk
